BrowserJS VS NodeJS
https://youtu.be/Oe421EPjeBE?t=299
- NodeJS
	- No Access to Web APIs 
	- No window
	- Server Side systems (Pure Logic, No interface)
	- File System
	- Versions
		- Incase if we build a browser api, It is out responsibilty to make sure ever browser on the planet supports it.
		- In case of Node App, you dont have to update the Node in your app incase Node releases the next version, unlike browser where you have to accommodate every browser update in order to provide uninterrupted access
	- CommonJS
		- This is like ES6 modules which we use in our browser
